Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were 
five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. 
Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, 
and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and 
sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.

For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places 
with her because she was a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn't actually in love, 
but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations 
conceal something eventually, even though they don't in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party 
together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered 
the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached 
the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached 
the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he 
might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.
